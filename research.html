      <h4>Detecting Oscillations in Biological Data with Gaussian Processes </h4>
      <p> Simons Centre @ NCBS Bangalore | <a href="./docs/Alleppey_Poster.pdf"><b>Poster</b></a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btad602"><b> Paper </b></a> <br>
      Guide: Prof. <a href="https://www.ncbs.res.in/faculty/shaon">Shaon Chakrabarti</a>, National Centre for Biological Sciences </p>

      <p> Existing oscillation detection methods fail to perform consistently well on noisy, non-stationary data (such as that obtained from qPCR experiments). We combined Gaussian Processes (GPs) with bayesian inference, using a recently-introduced GP kernel, to develop a novel approach to this problem. The method is available as an easy-to-use R package <a href="https://github.com/Shaonlab/ODeGP">here</a>.</p>    

      <h4>Effects of Chronic Hypo-Osmotic Stress (CHS) on Suspension Cells </h4>
      <p> <a href="https://www.mbi.nus.edu.sg/"> Mechanobiology Institute </a> Undergraduate Summer Training Programme | <a href="./docs/MUST_Poster.pdf"> <b> Poster </b> </a> <br>
          Guides: Dr. Bin Shen Wong & Prof. <a href="https://www.mbi.nus.edu.sg/rong-li/">Rong Li</a>, Mechanobiology Institute, NUS </p>

      <p> Human cells experience CHS in several disorders including edema, cirrhosis, SIADH, and cancer. We conducted experiments to compare the effects of CHS on suspension (Nalm6) cells to adherent (RPE) cells. Interestingly, a significant increase in cell cycle arrest of RPE cells relative to Nalm6 cells was observed via FACS. In contrast to RPE WT cells, CHS also induced signifcant cell death in Nalm6 cells afer 72h. </p>

      <h4>Estimating the Dynamics of Large Boolean Networks </h4>
      <p> B.Tech Thesis Part I | <a href="./docs/BTPreport.pdf"> <b> Report </b> </a> <br>
          Guide: Prof. <a href="https://www.che.iitb.ac.in/faculty/ganesh-viswanathan">Ganesh Viswanathan</a>, Biomolceular Engineering Lab, IIT Bombay </p>

      <p> Certain biological signalling networks drive isogenic cells to differing fates such as cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, or non-apoptotic cell death. Boolean models of large networks that reflect these dynamics enable more biologically accurate analyses of cell fate distributions, but it is computationally intractable to simulate such large networks. We developed and validated approaches to efficiently estimate their dynamics and enable analysis of steady state behaviour. </p>


      <h4>Probabilistic Edge Tuning of Boolean Networks to Influence Cell Fate </h4>
      <p> B.Tech Thesis Part II | <a href="./docs/BTPreportII.pdf"> <b> Report </b> </a> <br>
          Guide: Prof. <a href="https://www.che.iitb.ac.in/faculty/ganesh-viswanathan">Ganesh Viswanathan</a>, Biomolceular Engineering Lab, IIT Bombay </p>

      <p> Knocking out a node from a signalling network can change the distribution of steady-state cell fate probabilities in a population. However, due to biological cross-talk, the complete deletion of a node is not physically feasible. The partial inhibition of interactions of these nodes with other nodes was simulated in a boolean network through probabilistic edge tuning. The resulting changes in cell fate distributions were observed to correspond to data known from experiments. We also identified which node(s) in the network played a key role in making a particular state highly sensitive to edge-tuning, with respect to the shifts in its steady state probabilities for each cell fate. </p>
